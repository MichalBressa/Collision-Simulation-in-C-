# Collision-Simulation-in-C++

This project simulates collisions between different objects. collisions are calculated using real life physics formulas and programmed using C++, heavly employing OOP.
Each object has a collider of a specific type (sphere or AABB).

It was fun to make as it required me to revisit physics formulas and laws. I also found it as an amazing programming exercise - planning and implementing all the classes was very exciting.
